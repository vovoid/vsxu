<p><h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>This directory contains Visual Basic bindings for the GLFW v2.5.x
Windows DLL, and Visual Basic example programs. For further information
on how to use GLFW you should read the GLFW documentation.

<p><h2>2. Using GLFW from Visual Basic</h2>

<p><h3>2.1 General</h3>

<p>Using GLFW is slightly different from what Visual Basic users may be
used to, since GLFW replaces much of the functionality already built in to
Visual Basic. For instance, mouse clicks and key presses that occur in a
GLFW window are handled completely by GLFW, and in order to handle such
events you have to rely on GLFW functionality. While this may feel odd at
first, it does not necessarily have to be a disadvantage.

<p>The most important thing to comprehend is the way a GLFW "main loop"
works. Unlike ordinary Visual Basic programs, which are largely event
based, GLFW programs usually have a core loop that runs "forever" (until
aborted for some reason). To understand how it works, please look at the
supplied example programs. You should also read the GLFW Users Guide,
which explains how to use GLFW (regardless of programming language).


<p><br><h3>2.2 About the Visual Basic project</h3>

<p>In order to use GLFW from a Visual Basic project, you need to add the
file <b>glfw.bas</b> to your project (add existing module). It contains
all the necessary constant, structure and function definitions. You also
have to copy the file <b>glfw.dll</b> to your project directory.

<p>Typically you want to call OpenGL functions from your Visual Basic
program too. Threfore there are also bindings for opengl32.dll and
glu32.dll included in this distribution, namely <b>opengl32.bas</b> and
<b>glu32.bas</b>. Note that these files have not been tested fully, so
there may be bugs in them (please report them if you find them).

<p>If you wish to make a "pure" GLFW project (no forms), you can create a
a new module, in which you place a procedure named 'Main':

<p><b>Private Sub Main()<br>End Sub</b>

<p>Then select <i>Project Properties</i>, and under the <i>General</i>
tab, in the <i>Startup Object</i> field, select <b>Sub Main</b>. This is
how the example programs are meant to be used.

<p>It is of course possible to mix Visual Basic forms and GLFW code. For
instance you can have a form button that starts your OpenGL program by
initializing GLFW, opening a GLFW window and entering a GLFW main loop
etc.


<p><br><h3>2.3 Calling GLFW functions</h3>

<p>In principle, the GLFW functions can be called with the same syntax as
described in the GLFW Reference Manual. The primary difference is that
some GLFW functions are treated as Visual Basic subroutines ("Sub"), which
means that you should not use parentheses around the argument list. The
functions that are treated as subroutines are functions that, in 'C'
terms, return &quot;void&quot; (in other words, nothing). An example is
the <b>glfwGetMousePos</b> function, which should be called like this:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>glfwGetMousePos xpos, ypos</b>

<p>To be honest, my knowledge in Visual Basic is quite limited, so there
may be other options and other things to consider. Have a look at the
example programs for examples of how to call GLFW functions.


<p><br><h3>2.4 Using callback functions</h3>

<p>GLFW callback functions are very similar to Visual Basic event
subroutines (e.g. <b>Private Sub Command1_Click()</b>). The primary
difference is that you have to specify the functions manually, using GLFW
functions (such as <b>glfwSetMousePosCallback</b>). GLFW callback
functions, once registered, are called only when <b>glfwSwapBuffers</b> or
<b>glfwPollEvents</b> are called (if there are any corresponding events
pending).

<p>Creating callback functions is pretty simple. All you need to do is to
declare a subroutine as specified in the GLFW Reference Manual, but of
course translated to Visual Basic. For instance a mouse position callback
function should, in 'C' language, be:

<p><b>void GLFWCALL MyFun( int xpos, int ypos)</b>

<p>Never mind the GLFWCALL thing (it has to do with 'C' language calling
conventions). In Visual Basic, this translates into:

<p><b>Private Sub MyFun(ByVal xpos As Long, ByVal ypos As Long)</b>

<p>To register the callback function you should use the <b>AddressOf</b>
operator, like this:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>glfwSetMousePosCallback AddressOf MyFun</b>

<p>Done!
